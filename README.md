# Sonar Rock and Mine Prediction 

A machine learning project to classify sonar signals as **Rock** or **Mine** using various algorithms and data analysis techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to the **Sonar dataset** from the Kaggle. Each data point is a sonar signal represented by 60 numeric features. The goal is to predict whether the object is a **mine** or a **rock** based on the sonar returns.
